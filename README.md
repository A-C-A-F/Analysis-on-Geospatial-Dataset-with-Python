# Analysis-on-Geospatial-Dataset-with-Python
Data Analysis on Covid-19 Geospatial Dataset 2023 with Python

In this project, we will process geospatial data using Python. We will go through different geoprocessing tasks including how to create Geodataframes from CSV files and perform a spatial join.

__Note__: If the url of the dataset is not working, you can download in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arielfelices/covid-19-geospatial-dataset-2023) the copy of the dataset I used in this project.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Perform Spatial join with different datasets.
2.	Create Different Maps and visualization with `Geopandas`
3. 	Learn how to preprocess geospatial data with Python


### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Reading Data
- __Task 2:__ Geodataframe
- __Task 3:__ Plotting Maps
- __Task 4:__ Join & Merge
- __Task 5:__ Choropleth Map
